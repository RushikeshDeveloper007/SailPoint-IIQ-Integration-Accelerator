IAM Audit Summary Report
Project: SailPoint IIQ Integration Accelerator
Prepared by: Rushikesh Bommineni
Date: July 21, 2025
Purpose: Simulate an internal IAM audit focused on access provisioning, lifecycle governance, and privacy compliance readiness.

Key Components Reviewed:
Provisioning Rules: Verified Beanshell scripts follow least-privilege principle

RBAC Model: Checked JSON role mappings for overlap and SoD (Segregation of Duties)

DSAR Workflows: Simulated GDPR/CCPA requests and confirmed proper identity traceability

Access Reviews: Sample review template aligns with ISO 27001 & SOX quarterly reviews

Observations:
Control Area	Status	Comments
Joiner-Mover-Leaver	Passed	JML automation covers core HR events
Custom REST Connector	Passed	Integration tested with mock API
Role Engineering	Needs Tuning	Some roles may need clearer job-function separation
DSAR Handling	Passed	JSON generator handles data exports well
Certification Template	Passed	Campaign structure supports periodic reviews

Audit Conclusion:
The integration accelerator demonstrates a scalable, governance-ready IAM foundation. Further enhancements may include separation of SoD roles and real-time audit logging for entitlement changes.
